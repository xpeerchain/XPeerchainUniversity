# 10. Efficient & Sustainable Security

Earlier we learned that mining power in Bitcoin centralizes over time. This occurs because it’s possible for proof-of-work to be gamed in such a way that a miner can achieve an advantage over their competition. All miners have to do to increase their chances of earning rewards is to figure out how to be faster than everyone else. Over time this drive to be faster has led to the creation of the mining industry and specialized equipment. These developments have caused the cost of entry to skyrocket in price to the point of being unaffordable for normal users.

Due to the fact that a large miner will always be able to process more hashes per second, they will always have a higher probability of mining a block than a small miner. It is possible for a small miner to solve a block, but their odds of doing so are extremely miniscule to the point that they could mine consistently for many years before being able to find one.

Unfortunately, not many people can afford to waste money on electricity costs for years on end for such tiny odds of mining a block. Electricity bills have to be paid in the meantime and that length of time to wait in between rewards is just too great without being paid. Once regular rewards are no longer possible they are likely to just quit mining altogether, leaving a shrinking number of larger miners to compete amongst themselves.

Proof-of-stake in XPeerchain however is not capable of being gamed in the same way. Since proof-of-stake does not rely on hashing power in order to achieve consensus, no specialized equipment can be designed in order to increase the chances of minting a block. Faster processing speeds therefore have absolutely no effect on the probability of producing new blocks in XPeerchain.

The consensus rules of XPeerchain are completely different and minters must work within the confines of these protocol rules in order to be able to produce blocks. Because rules about hashing power are replaced with time based rules, it is no longer necessary to purchase expensive equipment in order to give yourself an advantage over others.

Proof-of-stake minting itself is an efficient process that is capable of being performed on any lightweight CPU based device, from phones and tablets to basic desktop and laptop computers. Many XPeerchain nodes for example are currently minting on inexpensive Raspberry Pi devices. Due to the nature of proof-of-stake’s time based consensus rules, it is extremely low-cost to operate a full minting node and the overall blockchain requires very little energy to secure.

## Qualities of Proof-of-Stake Consensus

Due to these innovations, XPeerchain can be considered the first truly efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. As a result, proof-of-stake consensus impacts the XPeerchain blockchain in a number of beneficial ways.

**Efficient & Sustainable:** Proof-of-stake in XPeerchain is efficient because network security is not dependent on wasting massive amounts of electrical energy. Instead minters invest in coins and time in order to emulate the proof-of-work process. This is done by simply opening their wallet app, sending coins to their xpeerchain address and letting them sit while they are occasionally selected by the protocol to mint the next block. This process is both energy and cost efficient, which makes XPeerchain a long-term sustainable network capable of operating indefinitely.

**Aligning Interests:** Because coin owners are the ones who produce new blocks in proof-of-stake, this means security providers and users of the network are ultimately the same group of people. So rather than miners and users being out of alignment like in proof-of-work based networks, minters and users in XPeerchain are the same exact people which means interests are completely aligned. All security providers are forced to own a stake in the network through ownership of xpeerchain. This causes everyone to have a similar financial interest in the long-term future of the network, which leads to much less conflict between factions with different ideas about how the blockchain should develop and evolve.

**User Governance:** Because users in XPeerchain have the ability to produce blocks, they also have the power to influence and determine the future direction of the network. This user governance is only possible because proof-of-stake grants power over the network to stakeholders. As such, XPeerchain is the very first blockchain capable of allowing its protocol rules to be governed directly by its users, making for a network that is far more democratic.

**Global Security:** As a direct consequence of a resource efficient consensus mechanism, the number of people capable of participating in creating blocks and securing the network is much expanded. Security providers are no longer drawn to geographical locations with cheap electricity. Due to how cost efficient proof-of-stake is to operate a node, minting nodes can be setup anywhere in the world. This allows XPeerchain to maximize its level of decentralization and achieve global security from minting users all around the world.

**Price Independent Security:** Unlike proof-of-work where miners are completely dependent on the market price of a blockchain’s native token to ensure profitability, XPeerchain contains no such price dependency. Proof-of-stake minters are compensated as motivation to provide consistent security, however since this process is so inexpensive to perform minters actually have the ability to voluntarily operate a minting node without compensation if they want to.

Even without compensation from the network, the process of minting helps to secure the blockchain and along with it a stakeholder’s overall investment. The ability to decide which version of the protocol to run also gives a minter the opportunity to make their voice heard concerning future upgrades to the network. These are two important reasons a stakeholder may have to want to run a node for free, however compensation is automatically provided which makes it even better to participate. Voluntarily running a proof-of-work mining node is just not possible due to the requirement of being profitable enough in order to afford the associated costs of participating.

Since 2012 though it has been proven that XPeerchain is capable of sustaining its network security even during the lowest periods of demand where market price was close to zero. If the network is capable of surviving extremely stressful conditions like these then it can likely survive anything the market throws at it. There is a good reason why XPeerchain has been called the nuclear bomb shelter of crypto. It is highly capable of withstanding almost any scenario.

## Higher Resistance to Censorship

As explained above, the efficiency of proof-of-stake results in a blockchain network that can easily be secured by people all over the world who hold some amount of xpeerchain. This global decentralized security makes the XPeerchain network incredibly difficult to censor and shut down. It is similar to downloading files through a bittorrent network.

In a bittorrent network, many people around the world operate nodes where they hold a full copy of the file that is trying to be downloaded. Pieces of the file are downloaded from different nodes until the full file has finished downloading. If a government were to deem this file sharing illegal and attempt to shut down the torrent network, they would be forced to target every single node on the network no matter where they happen to exist in the world. Even then, there is nothing stopping more torrent nodes from popping up that share the exact same file. As long as one node exists that shares the file, it can be downloaded and spread to others.

A government’s reach extends only as far as its own borders, therefore in order to target nodes halfway across the world they would need to rely on cooperation from other governments which is not always easy to attain. Due to the inability to easily target nodes offering a file for download, it is incredibly difficult for governments or other entities around the world to shut down file sharing torrent networks.

XPeerchain works in a similar way where minting nodes that process transactions can be operated from anywhere in the world as long as the minter has access to a computer, minimal electricity, some amount of xpeerchain and an internet connection. Geographical decentralization of minting nodes makes it incredibly difficult to shut down the XPeerchain network, but when the number of nodes around the world expands to thousands or even tens of thousands then it essentially becomes impossible to censor.

In systems like these, individual nodes are usually called peers. Together they act as a peer-to-peer network. This is where XPeerchain obtained its name. It was originally introduced by Sunny King as `XPC`, which stood for peer-to-peer coin. Shortly after it was simply renamed to XPeerchain. Due to the nature of proof-of-stake, XPeerchain is the world’s first truly decentralized peer-to-peer financial network.

## Reduced Incentive for Minters to Centralize

Proof-of-stake minters in XPeerchain are compensated with block rewards that are automatically generated by the network, similar to Bitcoin. Users who engage in the proof-of-stake minting process earn an annual total of about 1% on their holdings every year. This interest on the stake they hold comes to them throughout the year as blocks are produced and not all at the same time.

For example, a user who is minting with 10,000 coins in their wallet would receive many block rewards throughout the year that end up totaling about 100 xpeerchains. 100 coins is the 1% annual interest that was earned on the 10,000 coins that were held in that minter’s wallet throughout the year.

There is a criticism that exists in the crypto community about proof-of-stake that states the rich get richer. Recall that in Bitcoin a large miner can essentially game the entire system and achieve an advantage over everyone else by using mining equipment with faster computer processing ability. This rich get richer argument against proof-of-stake basically states the same exact thing, except that minters with large stakes can achieve an advantage over minters with small stakes.

The argument states that large minters with lots of coins in their wallet are able to gain higher amounts of coin age, which gives them an advantage over all other proof-of-stake minters. This increased advantage allows them to mint more blocks and gain more rewards than everyone else participating in the network.

Over time this allows the rich stakeholders in the network to collect more rewards and become even richer to the disadvantage of all other participants. New coins will increasingly get rewarded to rich stakeholders and eventually the majority of power in the network will centralize to those rich stakeholders.

This commonly stated scenario however is a myth and a misunderstanding of how proof-of-stake works in XPeerchain. When the entire money supply grows due to the new coins coming from the minting process, all XPeerchain holders who participate in minting can maintain their relative share of the network. Although large stakeholders do generate a higher total number of blocks and xpeerchain rewards than small stakeholders, they cannot, in percentage terms, pull ahead of other minters.

For example, let’s say the entire XPeerchain supply is 100,000 coins. A small minter who owns 1% of the supply owns 1,000 coins. A large minter who owns 10% of the supply owns 10,000 coins. After a full year of consistent minting, the small minter would own about 1,010 coins while the large minter would own 10,100 coins.

While the large minter technically did mint more blocks and 100 coins while the small minter earned only 10 coins, their overall ownership of the supply in percentage terms did not change. The small minter still owns 1% of the supply and the large minter still owns 10%. Even though the large minter was able to earn more overall coins, they were not able to increase their percentage of ownership over that of the small minter. The rich stakeholder therefore did not become any richer than they were before the minting process started. Both minters ended up maintaining their relative share of the network without any change.

In this way proof-of-stake consensus can be used to secure the XPeerchain blockchain without providing an incentive for minters to centralize over time. As long as a minter participates in the proof-of-stake minting process then they will receive the rewards they deserve. If they don’t participate in minting however then those potential rewards will be forfeited.

## Minting Pools

One issue is that it does take small minters much longer to mint blocks. Depending on how few xpeerchain they are minting with, it’s possible it could take over a year to successfully mint a block. The fewer coins they have sitting in their wallet, the lower the overall coin age is that they will be able to build up and the lower their odds of being selected as the next block producer.

However unlike proof-of-work where it is pretty much impossible to mine consistently for years on end without earning money to pay the electricity bills, minting with proof-of-stake is such an inexpensive process that a minting node can operate for years without earning a reward.

Another potential issue is that at 10 minutes per block, there will not be enough blocks produced per year for every user in the network to be able to earn their annual interest. This is another reason why it may take longer than a year for some to successfully mint a block. However both of these issues can be solved by introducing minting pools.

Minting pools are very similar to mining pools. With mining pools miners share their hashing power with a pool and when a block is found they are partially rewarded based on the proportion of hashing power that they contributed to finding that block. With minting pools however minters pool their coin age. By pooling together with other small stakeholders, they can earn more regular rewards than what they could if they minted alone by themselves. In a minting pool, when a block is found minters would be partially rewarded based on the proportion of coin age they contributed to finding that block.

It was explained earlier that mining pools had a large part in further centralizing Bitcoin, however it is unlikely that minting pools on XPeerchain would cause such a drastic turn toward centralization. In Bitcoin small miners who don’t join pools basically have no chance at all of mining a block. In XPeerchain however a small minter can still mint a block. It’s just that doing so by themselves may take quite a while. Minting pools just provide for an opportunity to earn rewards more regularly without the requirement of waiting so long.

## Cold Minting

Another concern about minting pools is the need for a minter to send their coins to the pool operator. Once they send off their coins, they technically don’t own them anymore and the pool operator has the choice of not returning them when the minter requests them to be sent back. However this problem can be solved with cold minting.

One major issue that has prevented larger numbers of XPeerchain stakeholders from participating in the minting process is the fact that a minter must bring their coins online on a hot wallet that is connected to the internet. Large holders are particularly wary about this because it opens up the possibility for their computer to be hacked and their xpeerchains to be stolen.

As long as a minter is required to bring their coins online in order to mint, there will always be some level of risk that their coins could be stolen out from under them if proper security measures are not taken. This fear from stakeholders of losing their investment naturally works to limit participation rates in minting.

However there is a solution that has been under consideration since 2014. Cold minting is an upgrade to the XPeerchain protocol that would give users additional functionality. Upon implementing cold minting, users would have control of two different keys. One key would be used by users in order to move or spend their coins. This key actually exists today in the current protocol and can be added to a user’s wallet in order for them to start minting with their coins.

A second key however would be created called a minting key. This key has no power to move or spend a user’s coins and can only be used to participate in the minting process. So for example a large stakeholder who is afraid of getting hacked would keep their spending key to themselves and not let it touch any computer, especially one that is connected to the internet.

Instead they would add their minting key to their XPeerchain wallet and use that to securely participate in the minting process. By only using the minting key there is no possibility of a hacker discovering their spending key and withdrawing coins from their wallet. If their spending key never touches any computer connected to the internet and they properly secure this key somewhere offline then their xpeerchain can never be stolen.

This minting key would allow a stakeholder to not only securely mint alone by themselves but it also solves the issue with minting pools. Rather than a minter giving up direct control of their xpeerchain by sending them away to the operator of a minting pool and fully trusting them to return those coins when asked, the operator would instead be given the stakeholder’s minting key.

The minting key allows a stakeholder the ability to keep their coins secure in their own wallet while at the same time giving pool operators access so their coins can contribute to the minting pool. Using this setup, the minter gets to participate in the pool without risking the security of their coins. This allows the minting process to remain trustless while small stakeholders get the chance to earn more regular rewards.
