# 2. What is a Blockchain?

Ever since the initial launch of Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has proliferated throughout the world in many different forms. This new and exciting technology has the potential to impact society in innumerable ways. In this section we will explain what a blockchain really is, how it functions and its core purpose.

## Centralized Private Ledgers

At its core, the XPeerchain blockchain is a distributed public ledger. A ledger is traditionally a document such as a spreadsheet in which accounts are kept of economic transactions, including credits, debits, and balances. They are generally used to keep track of an individual's or organization's financial standing or other recordable data such as assets, liabilities, income, expenses and capital.

Before the invention of the blockchain, it was necessary for individuals to manage their financial accounts by placing their trust in a centrally managed third party organization which maintained its own private ledger. Example services include banks, credit card issuers, money transfer services and other financial institutions.

A high degree of trust is placed by customers in these centralized services and the people running them, all of whom are human and fallible. The ledgers of customer data are kept private and not routinely shared with the public for independent verification. In this outdated model, the customer is forced into a situation where they need to fully trust that the organizations handling their financial accounts are being truthful and accurate.

This lack of transparency is a central point of failure because it forces the customer to trust that the organization is acting in their interest and not against them. The need to trust without the ability to verify can invite errors, unaccountability and even outright fraud and corruption within an organization, which can impact customers in a damaging way.

## Distributed Public Ledgers

Blockchain technology however completely removes the need for the user to trust a centralized organization in this way. Instead, the blockchain introduces the concept of a shared or distributed public ledger where a copy of the ledger is held by a large group of people all around the world who work together to validate transactions that are initiated by users of the blockchain network. The individuals who carry out this important work are known as validators.

Each validator hosts a full copy of the public ledger and operates a node, a program that validates incoming transactions and relays them to other nodes held by other validators. Together, these validators form a global network of nodes that secure the blockchain by protecting against fraud. Transactions initiated by users of the blockchain are broadcast across this network of nodes and they are either validated and accepted, or detected as invalid and rejected (as in the case where a malicious user attempts the same transaction twice in what is called a double spend attack).

Thus, rather than trust being concentrated in a central entity to manage its own private ledger without transparency or oversight, the blockchain distributes trust publicly and globally to a wide number of validators who work to prevent errors, alterations and acts of fraud. This open and transparent sharing of the public ledger allows each security validator the ability to independently verify the ledger's integrity. In this way the public ledger acts as a digitally shared truth about the state of the network.

## The Blockchain

The blockchain itself can be accurately described as a continuously growing list of individual transaction records called blocks. As transactions are initiated by users of the network they are broadcast out to the network of validation nodes. One by one these transactions are validated, grouped together and recorded into a block which is then attached to the end of the blockchain as the next link in the chain. Therefore every block is linked, forming one long cryptographically secured chain of blocks. When combined together these individual blocks of data form the entirety of the public ledger, which consists of all the transactions that have ever taken place on the network.

In Bitcoin and XPeerchain, a new block is added to the chain about every ten minutes, which contains all the transactions made by users in that period. Account balances on the public ledger are consistently and automatically updated with each new added block to reflect changes from these transactions.

## Distributed Consensus Protocol

Unlike a centrally managed entity that depends on user trust of authority figures who are capable of errors or intentional acts of fraud, the blockchain is designed with no such central point of failure. Instead user trust is placed in a blockchain's distributed consensus protocol, which is an automated process responsible for achieving majority agreement among the network's many validators on whether the public ledger can be considered valid or not. If the majority of validators working to secure the network can verify and agree that the public ledger is accurate and has not been tampered with, then it can be trusted as legitimate and held as absolute truth by all participants of the network.

A distributed consensus protocol is a coded set of rules that a blockchain runs on. This protocol and its underlying rules are entirely responsible for how a blockchain functions as well as its process for validating transactions and blocks. The protocol is also what gives the blockchain its many beneficial qualities, which are summarized below.

**Automated:** Since a blockchain protocol runs on code, security providers do not have to manually validate transactions and blocks, which means the consensus and verification process of the public ledger completely automated. From the standpoint of the end user, a submitted transaction is automatically processed by the network. From the standpoint of the validator, transactions submitted by users of the network are automatically verified and accepted or rejected by the node software they are running.

**Trustless:** For the first time in history, the blockchain can provide a network that is transparent, verifiable and one that can be trusted by all parties as it is impartial by its very nature. This unbiased or neutral quality of the blockchain is made possible by the public nature of the ledger and the ability of a large and globally decentralized group of security validators to verify its accuracy. This prevents the falsification of transactions and leads to a state of trustlessness in which all participants of the network can be assured that their data is guaranteed to be accurate. This state of trustlessness is the core value proposition of the blockchain. In this state the users of the network no longer need to trust anyone because security is automatically handled for them by the blockchain's consensus protocol. Users only have need to trust that this protocol continues functioning as it was designed to.

**Censorship Resistant:** Censorship resistance is another quality of the blockchain. Banks and payment processors are centralized entities that have the power to interfere with transactions of their users and freeze funds, especially if forced to do so by governments. The blockchain introduces a level playing field where no one has power over anyone else and censorship or freezing of transactions is not possible.

**Immutable:** The blockchain is immutable, meaning that recorded data is permanent and cannot be tampered with. Data is therefore locked into the blockchain forever, making it impossible for attackers, governments and other external threats to alter or falsify that transaction data.
